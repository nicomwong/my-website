                “I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:
                <ol>
                    <li>Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part
                        of the way the world works.
                    </li>
                    <li>Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and
                        revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.”
