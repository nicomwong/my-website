    How to develop your (technical) skills <i>without</i> a job: Open Source, Courses, and Certifications
    <br>(These three benefit resum√©.)
    <ul>
        <li>Open Source: interesting, real project, collaboration, closer to real SWE work (?)</li>
        <li>Courses: time commitment (3-6 months [?]), deep work, deep theoretical understanding</li>
        <li>Certifications: deep practical understanding, formal certification, may require some experience</li>
    </ul>

    How to meet people with/without a job: Conferences, Competitions
    <ul>
        <li>Competitions develop people and technical skills and are <i>competitive</i> :)</li>
        <li>Tech. conferences are great; you learn, hopefully a lot, and you gain exposure to fellow techies</li>
    </ul>

    <b>CHANGED</b>

    How to develop tech skills AND benefit your resume: Open Source & Projects
    <ul>
        <li>Open Source: interesting, real project, collaboration, closer to real SWE work (?)</li>
        <li>CHANGED: Courses are kind of irrelevant. Real project & work experience are
            highly superior, because what courses give you is a really good <i>theoretical</i> understanding.</li>
        <li>CHANGED: Certifications (certs) are still pretty good, especially AWS certs, because they provide practical
            understanding & usage. AWS is also a really popular cert.</li>
    </ul>

    How to meet people with/without a job: Conferences, Competitions
