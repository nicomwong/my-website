    <h1>Software Engineering Journey</h1>

    <h3>SDE 1 @ Amazon</h3>
    <h5>September 2022 - January 2023 (laid off)</h5>
    <h6>Info:</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Role: Backend</li>
        <li>Programming languages: Java, JSON, Gremlin graph query language</li>
        <li>Databases: Amazon Neptune graph database</li>
        <li>Database schemas: Custom property graph database schema (confidential)</li>
        <li>Team: ~4 junior, ~3 mid-level, 2 senior; 1 SDM, 1 senior SDM</li>
    </ul>
    <h6>Accomplishments:</h6>
    <ol>
        <li>Fix unhandled edge case - debug convoluted logic</li>
        <li>Increase test/code coverage - add unit and integration tests for a Guice module</li>
        <li>Implement automatic generation of test reports - use IaC and AWS IAM to generate JUnit test report in alpha
            and beta stages of CI/CD pipline</li>
        <li>API migration - modified endpoints and implemented changes across the codebase (validators, traversals,
            endpoints)</li>
    </ol>
    <h6>Challenges:</h6>
    <ol>
        <li>Helped resolve disagreement between two senior engineers - they disagreed on where to place API validation
        </li>
        <li>Huge unfamiliar codebase - got to learn inversion of control (IoC) / dependency injection via Google Guice
            [confusing at first], skill of code navigation (in IntelliJ IDEA), dependency mocking (Mockito)</li>
        <li>Unfamiliar internal tools - CRUX (code review web platform & CLI), Brazil dependency management and CLI
            build tools, AWS console (IAM, S3, CloudWatch, ..), Pipelines (CI/CD pipelines), IaC (internal amazon IaC
            platform)</li>
        <li>Rusty on Java - picked it (back) up quickly and learned some more in the process</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>How to develop your (technical) skills <i>without</i> a job: Open Source, Courses, and Certifications</h3>
    <br>(These three benefit resumé.)
    <ul>
        <li>Open Source: interesting, real project, collaboration, closer to real SWE work (?)</li>
        <li>Courses: time commitment (3-6 months [?]), deep work, deep theoretical understanding</li>
        <li>Certifications: deep practical understanding, formal certification, may require some experience</li>
    </ul>

    How to meet people with/without a job: Conferences, Competitions
    <ul>
        <li>Competitions develop people and technical skills and are <i>competitive</i> :)</li>
        <li>Tech. conferences are great; you learn, hopefully a lot, and you gain exposure to fellow techies</li>
    </ul>

    <b>CHANGED</b>

    How to develop tech skills AND benefit your resume: Open Source & Projects
    <ul>
        <li>Open Source: interesting, real project, collaboration, closer to real SWE work (?)</li>
        <li>CHANGED: Courses are kind of irrelevant. Real project & work experience are
            highly superior, because what courses give you is a really good <i>theoretical</i> understanding.</li>
        <li>CHANGED: Certifications (certs) are still pretty good, especially AWS certs, because they provide
            practical
            understanding & usage. AWS is also a really popular cert.</li>
    </ul>

    How to meet people with/without a job: Conferences, Competitions
    <ul>
        <li>Competitions develop people and technical skills and are <i>competitive</i> :)</li>
        <li>Tech. conferences are great; you learn, hopefully a lot, and you gain exposure to fellow techies</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Job Search since Feb. 2023</h3>
    <h4>March Update</h4>
    <p>Accomplishments: updated resumé over >3 iterations. current version on github</p>
    <p>Insights: discovered CS Career Hub discord server, some reddit communities, refer.me,
        Simplify.jobs (POGGERS); discovered that I like working with Cloud and GoLang</p>
    <p>Joys: joined ThePrimeagen discord server</p>
    <p>Loves: loved ThePrimeagen's YouTube content; discovered I love Rust (even though I haven't directly used it;
        I'll
        take a modernized version of C++ anyday because I love C++)</p>
    <p>Bonus: ChatGPT was the initial step into discovering many other things (tools, communities, sites, services,
        ..)
        and getting insight :)</p>

    <h3>Paxos Distributed K-V Store/Database Project [<a
            href="https://github.com/nicomwong/Paxos-Distributed-Key-Value-Store/blob/main/server.py">GitHub</a>]</h3>
    <h5>Challenges</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed from scratch. Requirement was to implement the protocol that we learned in class.</li>
        <li>Applied theoretical multi-threading and conurrency concepts (and got real experience with it)</li>
        <li>Complex multi-threading
            <ul>
                <li>Server class handles the following via multiple threads:
                    <ul>
                        <li>CLI input</li>
                        <li>receiving incoming messages</li>
                        <li>processing a queue</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>It also handles shared state/memory across the threads via class instance variables.</li>
                <li>The reason for this is that the protocol can have many instances running throughout the distributed
                    system at once.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Takeaways</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>I loved the experience of working through the complexity of the distributed system and solving how
            to design the multi-threading and shared state problems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>UC Santa Barbara</h3>
    <h4>Computer Engineering</h4>
    <h5>Learning highlights</h5>
    <h6>Distributed Systems</h6>
    <ul>
        <li>Mutexes: lock around a piece of data that more than one entity has access to</li>
        <li>Logical clock protocol (Lamport): a server's perspective knows the relative ordering of events it has seen
        </li>
        <li>Vector clock protocol: a server's perspective knows the relative ordering of events it has seen
            <i>per server</i>
        </li>
        <li>Byzantine Fault-Tolerance: handling cases of server failure or corruption (i.e. it is hacked/compromised)
        </li>
        <li>Paxos and Multi-Paxos Consensus protocols:
            <ul>
                <li>Purpose: Replicate a distributed state machine in a distributed system.</li>
                <li>Consistency: Data consistency is gauranteed by the protocol</li>
                <li>Fault-tolerance: as long as a majority of servers are alive, these properties are gauranteed</li>
                <li>Scalability: Multi-Paxos is the most efficient version of Paxos Consensus. It limits the maximum
                    number of rounds to 2 (?) per replication phase (which happens whenever the state machine is
                    updated). The maximum number of rounds for the leader phase is 2(?).</li>
                <li>Multi-Paxos vs. Paxos: Multi-Paxos eliminates the 3rd phase of Basic Paxos; Basic Paxos has 3
                    phases.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
